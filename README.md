# AI Agent Item Delivery

This project is a Python-based AI simulation where an agent delivers items across a map (maze). The agent uses the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm to navigate efficiently through the maze. The project is built using **Pygame** for the graphical interface and **Tkinter** for handling user input and settings.

## Features

- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: The agent intelligently finds the shortest path from the start point to the destination while avoiding obstacles.
- **Pygame Visual Representation**: The map, agent, and obstacles are visually represented using Pygame, making it easier to observe the agent's movements.
- **Tkinter UI**: The project uses Tkinter to provide a simple and intuitive user interface for controlling and setting up the map and agent parameters.
- **Customizable Maze**: You can create custom mazes and obstacles to challenge the agent's navigation.

## How it Works

1. **Map/Environment**: The agent is placed in a maze-like environment with obstacles.
2. **Agent Navigation**: Using the A* algorithm, the agent computes the most efficient route to the goal.
3. **Item Delivery**: The agent delivers items by following the optimal path, avoiding obstacles in the process.
